The coordinated process where multiple AI agents sequentially analyze an RFE, each contributing specialized expertise to create comprehensive requirements.

### **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
AI technique that enhances agent responses by retrieving relevant information from knowledge bases before generating analysis.

### **RFE (Request for Enhancement)**
A structured document describing a desired software feature, including business justification, technical requirements, and success criteria.

### **Refinement Agent Team (RAT)**
The complete AI-powered system that automates engineering refinement processes, reducing meeting time and improving ticket quality.

### **Workflow Orchestration**
The automated management of task sequences, state transitions, and agent coordination within the vTeam system.

## Technical Terms

### **API Endpoint**
RESTful web service interface for programmatic access to vTeam functionality.

### **FAISS**

### **Pydantic**
Python library for data validation and serialization using type hints.

### **@llamaindex/server**
TypeScript framework for building chat interfaces with LlamaIndex integration, used for vTeam's modern frontend user interface.

### **Vector Embedding**
Numerical representation of text that enables semantic similarity search in AI systems.

### **WebSocket**
Communication protocol enabling real-time bidirectional data exchange between client and server.

## Agent Roles & Personas

### **Archie (Architect)**
Principal-level AI agent responsible for technical feasibility assessment, architecture review, and design validation.

### **Derek (Delivery Owner)**  
Delivery Manager-level agent focused on implementation planning, ticket creation, and timeline estimation.

### **Lee (Team Lead)**
Engineering Manager-level agent handling team coordination, resource allocation, and execution oversight.

### **Olivia (Product Owner)**
Senior Product Owner agent managing acceptance criteria definition, scope validation, and stakeholder alignment.

### **Parker (Product Manager)**
Senior PM-level agent focused on business value assessment, prioritization, and stakeholder communication.

### **Stella (Staff Engineer)**
Staff-level engineering agent providing implementation complexity analysis and technical decision-making.

### **Taylor (Team Member)**
Senior Engineer-level agent handling detailed implementation considerations and development task breakdown.

## Workflow States

### **Agent Analysis**
Individual agent processing phase where a single agent analyzes the RFE from their specialized perspective.

### **Collaborative Review**
Multi-agent phase where agents build upon each other's analysis to create comprehensive requirements.

### **Criteria Refinement**
Process of improving and validating acceptance criteria for testability and completeness.

### **Decision Point**
Critical workflow stage where agents make approve/reject/needs-info recommendations.

### **Implementation Planning**
Final phase where approved RFEs are converted into actionable development tickets and timelines.

### **Stakeholder Communication**
Process of updating requestors and stakeholders on RFE status and next steps.

## Integration Terms

### **Anthropic Claude**
Primary large language model API used for agent intelligence and conversational capabilities.

### **GitHub Integration**
Connection to GitHub repositories for code context, documentation access, and issue management.

### **Jira Integration**
Connection to Atlassian Jira for automated epic and story creation from refined RFEs.

### **OpenAI Embeddings**
Text embedding service used for document similarity search in RAG systems.

### **Vertex AI**
Google Cloud AI platform providing alternative language model capabilities.

## Configuration Terms

### **Agent Configuration**
YAML-based definition specifying agent behavior, knowledge sources, and analysis prompts.

### **Data Sources**
External information sources (local files, GitHub repos, web pages) used to build agent knowledge bases.

### **Environment Variables**
System configuration settings for API keys, service endpoints, and runtime parameters.

### **Secrets Configuration**
Secure storage of API keys, authentication tokens, and sensitive system settings.

### **Template Variables**
Placeholder values in agent prompts that are replaced with actual content during analysis.

## Quality & Performance

### **Acceptance Criteria**
Specific, measurable, testable conditions that must be met for an RFE to be considered complete.

### **Business Value Score**
Numerical rating (1-10) assigned by PM agents to quantify the business impact of an RFE.

### **Complexity Rating**
Assessment (low/medium/high) of implementation difficulty and resource requirements.

### **Response Time**
Duration from RFE submission to complete agent analysis, target < 3 minutes for full workflow.

### **Token Limit**
Maximum amount of text content that can be processed by AI agents in a single analysis.

## Deployment Terms

### **Container Orchestration**
Management of containerized vTeam services using Docker and Kubernetes platforms.

### **Health Check**

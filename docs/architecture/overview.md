# System Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the RHOAI AI Feature Sizing system architecture, built on [Llama Stack](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The RHOAI AI Feature Sizing system is designed as a modular, AI-powered feature estimation platform that leverages Llama Stack for robust AI inference and processing capabilities.

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Application Layer

#### Main Application (`main.py`)
- Entry point for the application
- Orchestrates the feature sizing workflow
- Coordinates between different stages and tools

#### Processing Stages (`stages/`)
- **Feature Refinement** (`refine_feature.py`) - Analyzes and refines feature specifications
- **Estimation Engine** (`estimate.py`) - Performs AI-powered feature sizing
- **JIRA Draft Generation** (`draft_jiras.py`) - Creates structured JIRA tickets

#### Integration Tools (`tools/`)
- **JIRA Integration** (`mcp_jira.py`) - Handles JIRA API interactions and ticket management

### 2. Llama Stack Integration

The system leverages [Llama Stack](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for:

- **AI Inference** - Processing natural language feature descriptions
- **Agent-based Processing** - Structured AI workflows for feature analysis
- **Model Management** - Handling different LLM models for specific tasks
- **Tool Integration** - Extensible tool ecosystem for external integrations

### 3. Prompt Management (`prompts/`)

Structured prompt templates for consistent AI interactions:
- Feature refinement prompts
- Estimation guidelines
- JIRA ticket formatting templates

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Feature Sizing Workflow

1. **Input Processing**
   - User provides feature description via CLI/API
   - Raw feature data is validated and preprocessed

2. **Feature Refinement**
   - Llama Stack agents analyze the feature description
   - Structured prompts guide the refinement process
   - Enhanced feature specification is generated

3. **Estimation Process**
   - AI agents evaluate complexity factors
   - Historical data and patterns are considered
   - Size estimates with confidence intervals are produced

4. **Output Generation**
   - JIRA tickets are drafted with sizing information
   - Integration tools handle external system updates
   - Results are returned to the user
